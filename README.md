Post Planner API

The Post Planner API provides a comprehensive back-end interface for storing, creating, and filtering travel-centric content for various locations. The API primarily focuses on two content types: profile pages and post pages.

The profile page enables users to create their unique profiles, select their favorite travel activities, upload a profile picture, and even pen a brief description of themselves.

On the other hand, the post page allows users to post diverse images of their recent trips, add location information, and write a short paragraph to share their travel experiences with others.

# Project plan


# API
The API provides essential resources for managing user accounts, creating and commenting on content, as well as searching and filtering content by location. This allows front-end developers to implement the desired features in their application related to user-generated content and location-based searches

# Project structure
The project's general structure draws inspiration from the DRF-API walkthrough, which adheres to the best practices for implementing APIs in the industry. As a result, the serializer, model, and URL files are structured in a way that reflects the conventional approach to implementing APIs using the Django REST framework.
